	Description:		We have the ability to launch other scripting language environments in powershell using the #! directives at the top of scripts. 
				So launch the sh script driverScript.sh, this will launch a PowerShell script fileDescriptors.ps1. FileDesccriptors.ps1 does several
				types of output operations using IO redirection and the pipeline.

sh ./driverScript.sh
Get-Content fileDescriptors.ps1
