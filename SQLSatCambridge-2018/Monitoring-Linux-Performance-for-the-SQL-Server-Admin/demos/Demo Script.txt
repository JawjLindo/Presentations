Looking at our CPU Topology
4vCPUs 12GB RAM
Setup
	Freshly booted system
	Warm buffer pool for t1 in TestDB1 - read in table select * from testdb1.dbo.t1
	Instance Max Memory 8192
	htop configured to show threads and by tree
	Two SSH connections to SQL on Linux instance
	Connect VScode open demos.sql

CPU
	1. Processes and threads
		Launch htop, show that all the VIRT and RSS columns are the same for each thread because of the shared memory space.

	2. Run load average under CPU saturation
		./mySqlCmd.sh checkdb.sql

	Key Points 
	 - Primarily in kernel time while reading from disk and allocating pages in memory. 
	 - Once the workload is in memory, then CPU will drop and we�ll be mostly in user space.
	 - Load average goes up to above 2
	 - Observe different workers doing work, these corresponds to SQL tasks executing in a worker
	 - Table is larger than buffer pool, so PLE dips and we have to wait on IO as pages are pushed out and read in.
	 - Review process states R, S and D

	3. Exploring procfs
		ls /proc
		more /proc/cpuinfo
		lscpu
		pidof sqlservr
		cd /proc/PID/
		more cmdline
		more status (comes from task_struct)

	Bonus Material 
	pidstat -C "sqlservr"-u -p ALL 1
	strace -f -p PID

	strace like with durations
	sudo perf trace -p PID
	sudo perf top -p PID --sort comm,dso,symbol,cpu

Memory
	0. Warm up buffer pool 
		a. select * from testdb1.dbo.t1

	1. Memory layout
		a. free -m
		b. htop - look as RSS and VSZ

		c. Memory utilization and allocation types
			pidof sqlservr
			cd /prod/pid/
			more status (Review all VM attributes)
				VmPeak:	Peak virtual memory usage
		 		VmSize:	Current virtual memory usage
				VmLck:	Current mlocked memory
				VmHWM:	Peak resident set size
				VmRSS:	Resident set size
				VmData:	Size of "data" segment
				VmStk:	Size of stack
				VmExe:	Size of "text" segment
				VmLib:	Shared library usage
				VmPTE:	Pagetable entries size
				VmSwap:	Swap space used

	3. External Memory Pressure Demo and Excessive swapping
		a. start read workload
			./mysqlcmd.sh readtable.sql

		b. Review VSZ and RES for sqlservr in htop, should be around 8GB
			htop 
			
		c. Apply external memory pressure, but not enough to fill the swap file
			./memtest 7000
		
		d. In htop review RES for both sqlservr and memstat, also swap usage

		e. Observe the swap in/out of pages, identify thrasing due to read workload and memtest
			whole system
			vmstat 1 
			
		f. Individual process
			pidstat -r 1 (minor = uninitialized memory, major = from disk)

		g. Find the amount of a process that swapped out
			pidof sqlservr
			cd /prod/PID
			watch grep VmSwap status
			grep Huge /proc/meminfo 

		h. In VSCode, query sys.dm_os_memory_clerks, bpool still populated even though 1/2 of address space is paged out

		i. fg and kill memstat, RES of sqlserver will grow since read workload will pull the pages back in

		j. Query ring buffer for resource monitor alerts

	So what�s this mean? 
	Set max memory your instance to control memory allocation and control paging

	#Bonus Materials - view anonymous pages and memory map
	pmap -x PID of HE
	pmap -x PID of sqlservr #review anomymous pats, SFPs and other linux libraries loaded

Disk monitoring
	1. Identifying high I/O processes
		./mySqlCmd.sh checkdb.sql
		iotop
		pidstat -d 1

	2. Review iostat column definitions
		iostat -dx

	3. In VSCode, query dm_io_virtual_file_stats

	#Bonus Material
		Block sizes and file system configuration
		xfs_info /

Using sar to answer what happened when? Are these point in time samples? 
	1. CPU utilization
		sar -u  
		sar -u -P ALL. //per CPU breakdown
		sar -q	load averages
	
	2. Memory 
		sar -r

	3. Swapping/Paging
		sar -B
		sar -S

	4. Disk 
		sar -b
 
	5. Everything
		sar -A
		sar -A -P ALL | less
